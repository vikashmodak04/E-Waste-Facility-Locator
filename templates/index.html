          <h2>E-Waste: What You Need to Know</h2>
          <p>E-waste, or electronic waste, refers to discarded electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, televisions, and appliances. As technology advances, the rate of e-waste generation continues to rise, posing significant environmental and health risks if not managed properly.</p>
          <p>Here are some key points about e-waste:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Improper disposal of e-waste can lead to pollution of soil, water, and air due to the release of toxic chemicals and heavy metals.</li>
              <li><strong>Health Hazards:</strong> Exposure to hazardous materials found in e-waste, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, can result in serious health issues for humans and wildlife.</li>
              <li><strong>Resource Conservation:</strong> Recycling e-waste allows for the recovery of valuable materials like gold, silver, and copper, reducing the need for raw material extraction and conserving natural resources.</li>
              <li><strong>Regulations and Recycling:</strong> Many countries have implemented regulations for the proper disposal and recycling of e-waste to mitigate its environmental and health impacts. Recycling facilities and programs are available to collect and process e-waste safely.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It's essential to dispose of e-waste responsibly by recycling it through authorized facilities to minimize its negative effects on the environment and public health.</p>
